Running ToDo list for Teacher Pages:
- "Back" buttons for most Pages

- When course is added in "Create new course" need to add to select course drop down

- View drafts html page

-when questions are populated from database, we need a way to select which questions will be added to a bank
    -As in the select multiple questions functionality we talked about when making the 
    template on the whiteboard? I'm unsure how to apply it until we have actual question population
    but can make a script template for it. -P

Discussion for Teacher:
-In New Question popup, add option to determine question type
    -should this be a radio button?


Running ToDo list for Publisher Pages:
- "Back" button for newTB page

- Page where they view teacher comments and ratings
    -add to publisher question bank -L

-Should create course be a popup? It might be easier to add to the dropdown if its all
    on the same page--might be easier for updating the dropdown, might not. Need to do more research
    -For both publisher and teacher? yeah I think you're right -P
