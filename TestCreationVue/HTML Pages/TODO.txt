This is for Paige pls ignore


Running ToDo list for Teacher Pages:
- "Back" buttons for most Pages
- When course is added in "Create new course" need to add to select course drop down

- View drafts html page

Discussion for Teacher:
-For teacher_question, should Question Type dropdown be moved to viewTB page?
    -I think it's fine. The question type allows the teacher to see question types
        for the whole textbook so they can add to testbanks. They see all questions
        used in tests. -L
-For teacher_viewTB, add New Question button
    -I thought we wanted to add questions to testbanks from the question page -L
-In New Question popup, add option to determine question type

Running ToDo list for Publisher Pages:
- "Back" button for newTB page

- Page where they view teacher comments and ratings
    -add to publisher question bank -L

-Should create course be a popup? It might be easier to add to the dropdown if its all
    on the same page

Discussion for Publisher:
-Need View Question type button? idk
    -I dont think its necessary. The view question type is to add to testbanks for tests.
        Pubs don't need this functionality imo -L
